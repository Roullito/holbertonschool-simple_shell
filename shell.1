NAME
    Simple Shell - a basic UNIX command interpreter

SYNOPSIS
    ./shell

DESCRIPTION
    Simple Shell is a basic UNIX command-line interpreter built as a project
    for the Holberton School. It reads user input, parses it into arguments,
    and executes commands by searching for them in the directories listed
    in the PATH environment variable, or via a direct path if provided.

    Simple Shell supports executing external programs and includes a few
    built-in commands.

    Features:
      - Command execution via PATH lookup (e.g., "ls", "echo", "cat", etc.)
      - Direct command execution with absolute or relative paths (e.g., "/bin/ls")
      - Passing arguments to commands
      - Built-in "exit" to leave the shell with a specific status
      - Built-in "env" to print the current environment variables

BUILTINS
    The shell provides the following built-in commands:

    exit [status]
        Exit the shell.  
        If [status] is provided, the shell will exit with the given status.
        If no status is specified, the shell exits with status 0.

    env
        Print the current environment variables to the standard output.

EXIT STATUS
    The shell returns the exit status of the last executed command.
    If a built-in "exit [status]" is used, the shell exits with the specified status.
    If a command cannot be found, the shell returns 127.
    If an invalid exit status is provided, an error message is printed.

FILES
    No configuration files are required.
